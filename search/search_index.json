That depends on what kind of hybrids you are trying to make and what color the parent flowers are. First, it helps to understand how a flower breeds. There are a few unclear details but here's the gist of what happens from the internal code: At the start of a new day (5:00 AM), pick an available flower at random If that flower has been watered and is fully grown, it has a chance to reproduce The chance to reproduce depends on how many days it has been watered since last reproduction and how many of your friends have watered it that day. If the flower reproduction is successful, the flower will either: Self-clone if there are no available flowers of the same species to breed with OR Breed if there is an available flower of the same species touching it. The flower that it breeds with is chosen randomly if multiple are touching the reproducing flower. Whether the flower self-clones or breeds , the offspring appears in an empty tile adjacent to the parent flower. The parent flower(s) are marked as unavailable . Repeat steps 1-4 on the next randomly selected flower until all flowers have been considered. There are a couple of important things to note from this process. First, breeders may need to be careful of self-cloning, even in beds of flowers where they are all touching. We can exploit certain breeding patterns to make sure self-cloning doesn't happen. Second, new flowers can appear in any open space, so we only need to leave open spaces for the number of new flowers that we are expecting. This allows for planting patterns with more flowers and less open spaces to increase efficiency in that space. With this information in mind, this page lists a few potentially useful patterns. The sections list patterns depending on the kind of breeding that you are trying to do. Many of these patterns come from Backwardsn\u2019s Optimized ACNH Hybrid Recipes , where Backwardsn and J_MASTER have done a lot of research into good layouts. Patterns for Breeding Identical Parent Flowers The following patterns work well when you are trying to breed hybrids from two identical parents. For example, when you're trying to make Blue Pansies from two White Pansy parents (seed flowers). Since the parents are identical, we can make plots that hold many flowers to increase the number of potential new flowers and minimize the chance of self-cloning. You don't need to have these exact sizes, feel free to size down to fit your space. These patterns don't assume that you have open space on the outside. They could be fenced off, or next to other plots of flowers as long as they are of different species . Turtle A good pattern to consider, and works well for small plots of flowers. Hex-hole Very space-efficient and works well when you don't have any visitors watering your flowers. Slightly better than a grid pattern at reducing the chance of self-cloning, but you could go with either. Super Turtle A great pattern when you have multiple visitors watering your flowers. It has more open space for flowers to appear in than hex-hole. Diagonal The diagonal layout here is shown as an example of what not to do. Ultimately, it doesn't have enough flowers in the space to be worth it. Choose other patterns unless you like how this pattern looks. Patterns for Breeding Different Parent Flowers Because of the self-cloning problem, it also matters whether the desired offspring flowers are the same color as the parents or different colors. When the offspring is the same color as one parent When the offspring shares a color with one of the parents, you have to worry about self-cloning. One of the parents might clone itself, and it would be impossible to tell whether the offspring has the desired genetics. Choose one of these patterns to avoid self-cloning. For example, this might be useful when trying to make Red (special) windflowers (the ones that can make purple windflowers) from a Red (seed) windflower and Blue windflower parent. Previously, I've recommended patterns that block off certain parents. However, the layouts here are slightly better, and the idea of blocking can be confusing (and ugly!), so I no longer mention it. Simple pairs The simplest way to avoid self-cloning is to have pairs of flowers. It doesn't matter whether these pairs are horizontal, vertical, or diagonal as long as they don't touch another flower of the same species. Note : If one of the flowers is lucky enough to reproduce, the other one is chosen and both are made unavailable. This prevents the self-cloning of the other flower. The problem with this layout is that you generally need space around the pairs. This pair idea forms the basis for the other patterns one can use. 5x1 pattern Alternatively, you can use 5 flowers all in a line to avoid self-cloning. Here, the Red windflower can't self clone, because it can't be excluded when a flower breeds. Note : the flowers on the edges can still self-clone, so we could get Blue windflowers from the diagram below. But if the blue windflowers self-clone, you know it was a clone, since we are trying to get Red (special) windflowers in this breeding scheme. This pattern is very nice to line paths with but isn't as efficient as the independent pairs layout. Independent Pairs When you have multiple species of flowers to breed, you can save a lot of space by using the independent pairs pattern. The idea is to put alternating species of flowers together since they can't breed with each other. You can choose either layout below, they perform similarly. Both pack a large number of flowers into a small space. The only downside is needing to breed two species. When the offspring is a different color For example, if you're trying to breed Pink windflowers from Red (seed) and Yellow (seed) windflower parents. Since the offspring is a different color than both parents, you don't have to worry about self-cloning. The following patterns may work well, although the same-color offspring patterns above still work and might be more efficient Alternating Columns/Rows This pattern can be used as either rows or columns and works well in longer/taller spaces. Less space-efficient than an independent pairs type approach. You may get quite a few self-clones. Alternating Snake Similar in spirit to the 5x1 layout, the alternating snake can be used to line paths. Make sure that the corners have space but keep alternating. It's probably not the best for large block spaces, but can be used creatively. Checkerboard This pattern works about as well as the alternating columns/rows pattern, but with slightly fewer self-clones. You can modify this pattern to fit weird spaces, just keep the alternating checkerboard going as much as you can. Patterns for Cloning Flowers When you have rare flowers, it can often be better to clone them to get more. Some rare flowers can be used in patterns like the ones when the parents are identical when they have the genes to only make more of themselves. Specifically, this works for Blue Roses, Black Roses, and Purple Hyacinths, Pansies, Tulips, or Windflowers and can save space. If not, the following patterns can help in cloning. Cloning a single flower Cloning a single flower is simple, just make sure no other flowers of the same species are touching it. Cloning two flowers of different species When you have two flowers to clone that are of different species, you can place them next to each other. This is another nice way to line paths, just make sure you have open spaces on one side. Cloning four flowers of different species When you have four flower species to clone, you can make the plots a bit denser, just keep open spaces on both sides.

These two flower species vary for each person (for me, it's Cosmos and Windflowers). These species are also the species that are always available in your Nook stop. It's been confirmed that the genetics of flowers on mystery islands are the same as those sold in the the Nook stop, unless you happen upon a rare hybrid mystery island. There are two rare-hybrid mystery-islands, each with one of your two flowers species (for me, one has Cosmos and the other has Windflowers). These rare hybrids have excellent genetics for breeding rare flowers , dramatically increasing your odds of getting those rare flowers. This page shows what happens when you breed these rare-island hybrids for each species. I'll use a (MI) ending to indicate the mystery island varieties.

You probably only care about two kinds of roses: gold and blue. They've been the coveted flower in Animal Crossing for a long time, and that's unlikely to change. Gold roses are special in New Horizons, as they aren't technically hybrids. They have a chance to appear off any Black rose that is watered with a Golden Watering Can (DIY recipe given once a 5 Star town is achieved). Blue roses are especially difficult to breed because roses are the only flower to use 4 different \"genes\" to make hybrids, which means there's actually 81 distinct roses (even though many of them look the same), as compared to 27 for other flower species. To make things more difficult, Blue roses have only 1 distinct combination that will work. There's a few different methods that have been proposed, and I thought I would try to mention them all here. The simple method The mass production method (based on Paleh's guide) The efficient method (discovered by Backwardsn) Which method should you use? If you want to build a blue rose flower factory and are willing to put in the time, the mass production method is your best bet. If you want an efficient and easy way to make a few blue roses, then the efficient method is right for you. For the classic, tried and true method, see the simple method . Simple method for Blue Roses The simple method for Blue roses can be broken down in the following table, which shows some of the basic breeding patterns for roses starting from the seed bag flowers: Hybrid Color Parent 1 Parent 2 Chance Other possible colors Orange Red (seed) Yellow (seed) 50% Yellow Black Red (seed) Red (seed) 25% Red (seed), Pink Pink Red (seed) Red (seed) 25% Red (seed), Black Pink Red (seed) White (seed) 50% Red Purple White (seed) White (seed) 25% White (seed), White Orange (2) Black Yellow (seed) 100% - Red (special) Orange Purple 25% Red (not special), White Blue Red (special) Red (special) 1.5% Anything There's a few rows of this table that aren't needed, but may be useful in breeding other colors. Here's a step-by-step guide for breeding Blue roses by this simple method. Plant a plot of White (seed) roses. These White roses will mostly produce other white roses, but 25% of the hybrids will be Purple roses. Throw out the new White roses that appear, as they may have different genes than the ones you planted from seed bags. Move the purple roses into a separate area for the moment. Plant a plot of Red (seed) and Yellow (seed) roses in a large diagonal pattern so that only Reds are touching Yellows. 50% of the hybrids here will be Orange ; move them to a separate area. The other 50% will be Yellow , but different than the Yellow seed flowers. Plant these flowers elsewhere to prevent contamination. Take the Purple hybrids from Step 1 and the Orange hybrids from Step 2 and plant them in a large diagonal pattern so that only Purple roses are touching Orange roses. 25% of the hybrids that appear from this plot will be Red (special) hybrids that are different from the Red roses in seed bags. These are the Red roses that are capable of making Blue hybrids. Another 25% of the hybrids will be Red (not special) hybrids. These are also different from the Red roses in seed bags, but they have no ability to make Blue hybrids. It's impossible to tell the difference from this method. The other 50% of hybrids will be White. Throw these away or plant elsewhere. Take all of the Red hybrids (special and not special) into one large plot. Having a dense block patterns helps here to allow for the most combinations of flowers. Continue to grow this plot with flowers from Step 3 as you will want as many flowers as possible. About 1.56% of the hybrids from two Red (special) parents will make the coveted Blue rose. Unfortunately, your chances of getting one are small because you will have many red roses in this plot that will never make Blue. If you can build this plot to be quite large, the odds will increase and you will eventually have yourself a blue rose. Keep at it! The Mass Production Method The best way to actually make a lot of blue roses is more complicated, but strategically makes roses that have high chances of blue roses. At the end, you will have a Red (very special) rose that makes Blue roses 25% of the time (16x more likely than from the simple method). These Red (very special) roses can be bred with any Blue roses, and will only give you more Red (very special) roses or more Blue roses (50/50 split). There first major step is to follow the 9 steps in Paleh's guide under the section Guaranteed blue rose path . I hope to re-write that guide here soon with mass production in mind. Take the red roses from the last step, which I call Red (very special) roses. As you breed Red (very special) roses, put these into a separate plot (can be dense or diagonal). 50% of the hybrids here will be more Red (very special) , 25% will be White (the same White roses as Step 4 of Paleh's guide), and 25% will be Blue . Take any Red (very special) and Blue hybrids from Step 1 and add them to your plot of Red (very special) flowers. You want the Blue hybrids to be close to the center. Each combination of the Red (very special) and Blue hybrids will have 50% of it's hybrids be more Blue , and the other 50% be the Red (very special) . Both of these can be again added to the plot. If you run out of space in this plot, it's best to replace the Red (very special) flowers with Blue roses, since two Blue roses will only make more Blue roses. This process takes a long time to get set up, but quickly builds momentum when you have a few of the Red (very special) and Blue roses. For mass production and a long term goal of tons of Blue roses, I highly recommend this method. Backwardsn\u2019s Efficient Method I came across an efficient method for making a blue rose from Backwardsn\u2019s Optimized ACNH Hybrid Recipes . He used an optimization procedure to figure this method out, and its quite different from the other methods. I believe this to be the fastest way to get a single blue rose, but if you want many blue roses I still recommend the above mass production method . I've summarized his method below: Plant Red (seed) and White (seed) flowers in a large blocked off pattern where the Red (seed) flowers are blocked off. 50% of the hybrids here will be a Red hybrids , which could be of two genetics (call them H1 and H2). Plant Red (H1/H2) from Step 2 and Yellow (seed) flowers in a large blocked off pattern where the Red (H1) flowers are blocked off. about 12% of the hybrids produced will be Red (H3) hybrids . You will also get some Yellow, Orange, and White hybrids here, discard them. Take all of the Red (H3) hybrids from Step 2 and plant into a dense or diagonal plot. 75% of hybrids produced will be Red , Orange , and Black roses. About 1.5% of the hybrids here will be Blue roses! You will also get Purple, White, and Yellow roses from this, discard them. Take all of the Red , Orange , and Black roses from Step 3 and plant them into a big dense block. The hybrids from this dense block will be all sorts of colors, but about 1/45 (2%) will be Blue roses Discard other hybrids from this block, but continue to add Red, Orange, and Black roses from Step 3 to increase the number of flowers and thus the chances of getting a Blue rose. The one downside to this method is that your odds of getting a Blue rose don't increase.

Getting Purples Fast Watch out for guides that show getting Purple windflowers from Pink hybrids. The fastest way is to create a special Red windflower hybrid that can make Purple windflowers. Here's the secret: Make Blue hybrid flowers from a White (seed) and a White (seed) hybridization in a dense pattern . Breed Blue flowers with Red (seed) flowers in one of the patterns that avoids self-cloning of the Red (seed) windflower to create Red (special) flowers. Provided there are no clones, 100% of the hybrids from the breeding will be Red (special) flowers. Plant all of the Red (special) flowers into another plot in a dense pattern . Each pair of flowers that are touching will have 6.25% of their hybrids become Purple . Take purples and go to the next section. The remaining non-purple hybrids can have any kind of genetics and should be thrown out. Note : if you have space on your island and really want a purple, you may take all the blue hybrids produced from this step and put them in a separate plot. 67% of them are a special Blue windflower that can make purples 25% of the time, but the other 33% will never make purples. Worst case, they produce more Blue windflowers, which are cool anyways. Transitioning to Mass Production The first option for mass producing Purple windflowers is to try and self-clone them (see here for more details). Once you have enough, you can put them all into a dense plot to save space. If you have plenty of space, the following method might work to get lots of Purple windflowers faster: Once you have a Purple windflower, take it any 4 of your Red (special) flowers to make a diagonal pattern with the purple in the middle. 25% of the hybrids from this plot will be Purple windflowers, which is 4x better than Step 3. 25% of the hybrids from this plot will be a Blue (special) windflower that can produce more purples. The other 50% will be Red . Some are Red (special), and some are Red with even better genes. Throw these into your Red (special) plot from Step 3 to increase your odds there. Note : you may get some self-cloning here, but that alright. The 4 Red (special) flowers help to increase the chances of getting the Purple windflower to breed each day. Move all Blue (special) and Purple windflowers from Step 1 into a separate plot. It's best to choose one that avoids self-cloning , but any of these patterns with two different parents will work. Now, hybrids will be 50/50 Purple/Blue, and the Blues are all more Blue (special) flowers. Keep building this out with the Blue/Purple from Steps 1 and 2 until it is the size you want. Once it is full, you can replace the Blue (special) windflowers with Purples, which make more Purples 100% of the time with other Purple flowers. Important : Do not let any of the Blue (special) windflowers touch, because these can produce the regular blues which can't make Purple windflowers. To Mass Produce Blue Windflowers If all you want is a lot of blue windflowers, the method to mass produce them is very straightforward. However, know that if you want to make purple windflowers, you will actually make plenty of blue along the way, and it might be better to follow the steps to mass produce purple windflowers . Plant White (seed) windflowers in a dense pattern . When White hybrids appear, throw them away (or sell, or plant elsewhere), because some of them are White windflowers that will never produce Blue. 25% of the hybrids in this areas will be Blue hybrids. Once a blue hybrid appears, go to step 2. Replace White (seed) flowers with Blue hybrid A Blue hybrid bred with a White (seed) is twice as likely (50%) to spawn a Blue . Once you get another Blue hybrid, go to step 3. Continue replacing White (seed) flowers with Blue hybrids, starting with the White (seed) flowers that touch the most Blue flowers, then those touching the most other White (seed) flowers. A Blue hybrid bred with a Blue hybrid will only spawn a Blue (4x as likely as the White + White combination). Eventually, after repeating step 3 many times, the entire flower bed will be Blue flowers. At this point, every hybrid in this area will also be Blue , and you will be mass producing Blue flowers!
