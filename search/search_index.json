That depends on what kind of hybrids you are trying to make. The basics of breeding suggest that any flowers of the same species that are touching have a chance to make a hybrid (flowers can touch diagonal). Each flower also has a chance to clone itself, although there is not a consensus on whether this happens when the flower is touching another flower of the same species. To be safe, it's best to assume that any flower can clone at any time. There's a couple breeding patterns I will reference often throughout these guides, so I figured that I would show diagrams of them here: X Pattern A basic diagonal pattern which may be useful if you have a rare flower in the center. There are 4 possible pairs of flowers that can hybridize (each touching diagonall). Cross Pattern Similar idea to the cross pattern, but if there's no rare flower, you get 4 pairs of flowers that can hybridize using only 4 flowers. Best for a bunch of the same flowers (e.g. White seed flowers). TODO: edit flowers in these patterns Blocked-off Patterns When you are trying to make a specific type of flower, it can sometimes help to block off certain flowers in the above patterns to ensure that their clones don't appear. This makes the most sense in an example. Example: Blocked-off X Say that we want to make Red (special) windflowers to eventually get Purple windflowers. Red (special) windflowers are bred from Red (seed) and Blue windflowers. Accordingly, we might set up the X pattern below. But there's a problem! The red flower in the middle might clone itself when watered, and we would have no way of distinguishing between the Red (special) flowers and the Red (seed) clones. Because the clones can only appear next to the flower it's cloned from, we block off the red flower with some object. You can use stone paths, fences, or other items for this. Hybrids can appear in any space next to the blue flowers, and we know that these flowers are Red (special) windflowers. The \"Grey spaces\" indicate a \"blocked off\" square. Hybrids will appear in the open spaces on the outside of this flower block. Blocked-off Pattern (large) When you have large plots of land available, you can create a large blocked-off pattern with an open space in the middle that may be more efficient. Make sure to have open land on the outside of this pattern, as that is where the hybrids can appear. A hybrid can also appear in the very center of this plot.","title":"Breeding Patterns"},{"location":"breeding-patterns/#breeding-patterns","text":"How should you plant your flower?

You probably only care about two kinds of roses: gold and blue. They've been the coveted flower in Animal Crossing for a long time, and that's unlikely to change. Gold roses are special in New Horizons, as they aren't technically hybrids. They have a chance to appear off any Black rose that is watered with a Golden Watering Can (DIY recipe given once a 5 Star town is achieved). Blue roses are especially difficult to breed because roses are the only flower to use 4 different \"genes\" to make hybrids, which means there's actually 81 distinct roses (even though many of them look the same), as compared to 27 for other flower species. To make things more difficult, Blue roses have only 1 distinct combination that will work. There's a few different methods that have been proposed, and I thought I would try to mention them all here. The simple method The mass production method (based on Paleh's guide) The efficient method (discovered by Backwardsn) Which method should you use? If you want to build a blue rose flower factory and are willing to put in the time, the mass production method is your best bet. If you want an efficient and easy way to make a few blue roses, then the efficient method is right for you. For the classic, tried and true method, see the simple method . Simple method for Blue Roses The simple method for Blue roses can be broken down in the following table, which shows some of the basic breeding patterns for roses starting from the seed bag flowers: Hybrid Color Parent 1 Parent 2 Chance Other possible colors Orange Red (seed) Yellow (seed) 50% Yellow Black Red (seed) Red (seed) 25% Red (seed), Pink Pink Red (seed) Red (seed) 25% Red (seed), Black Pink Red (seed) White (seed) 50% Red Purple White (seed) White (seed) 25% White (seed), White Orange (2) Black Yellow (seed) 100% - Red (special) Orange Purple 25% Red (not special), White Blue Red (special) Red (special) 1.5% Anything There's a few rows of this table that aren't needed, but may be useful in breeding other colors. Here's a step-by-step guide for breeding Blue roses by this simple method. Plant a plot of White (seed) roses. These White roses will mostly produce other white roses, but 25% of the hybrids will be Purple roses. Throw out the new White roses that appear, as they may have different genes than the ones you planted from seed bags. Move the purple roses into a separate area for the moment. Plant a plot of Red (seed) and Yellow (seed) roses in a large diagonal pattern so that only Reds are touching Yellows. 50% of the hybrids here will be Orange ; move them to a separate area. The other 50% will be Yellow , but different than the Yellow seed flowers. Plant these flowers elsewhere to prevent contamination. Take the Purple hybrids from Step 1 and the Orange hybrids from Step 2 and plant them in a large diagonal pattern so that only Purple roses are touching Orange roses. 25% of the hybrids that appear from this plot will be Red (special) hybrids that are different from the Red roses in seed bags. These are the Red roses that are capable of making Blue hybrids. Another 25% of the hybrids will be Red (not special) hybrids. These are also different from the Red roses in seed bags, but they have no ability to make Blue hybrids. It's impossible to tell the difference from this method. The other 50% of hybrids will be White. Throw these away or plant elsewhere. Take all of the Red hybrids (special and not special) into one large plot. Having a dense block patterns helps here to allow for the most combinations of flowers. Continue to grow this plot with flowers from Step 3 as you will want as many flowers as possible. About 1.56% of the hybrids from two Red (special) parents will make the coveted Blue rose. Unfortunately, your chances of getting one are small because you will have many red roses in this plot that will never make Blue. If you can build this plot to be quite large, the odds will increase and you will eventually have yourself a blue rose. Keep at it! The Mass Production Method The best way to actually make a lot of blue roses is more complicated, but strategically makes roses that have high chances of blue roses. At the end, you will have a Red (very special) rose that makes Blue roses 25% of the time (16x more likely than from the simple method). These Red (very special) roses can be bred with any Blue roses, and will only give you more Red (very special) roses or more Blue roses (50/50 split). There first major step is to follow the 9 steps in Paleh's guide under the section Guaranteed blue rose path . I hope to re-write that guide here soon with mass production in mind. Take the red roses from the last step, which I call Red (very special) roses. As you breed Red (very special) roses, put these into a separate plot (can be dense or diagonal). 50% of the hybrids here will be more Red (very special) , 25% will be White (the same White roses as Step 4 of Paleh's guide), and 25% will be Blue . Take any Red (very special) and Blue hybrids from Step 1 and add them to your plot of Red (very special) flowers. You want the Blue hybrids to be close to the center. Each combination of the Red (very special) and Blue hybrids will have 50% of it's hybrids be more Blue , and the other 50% be the Red (very special) . Both of these can be again added to the plot. If you run out of space in this plot, it's best to replace the Red (very special) flowers with Blue roses, since two Blue roses will only make more Blue roses. This process takes a long time to get set up, but quickly builds momentum when you have a few of the Red (very special) and Blue roses. For mass production and a long term goal of tons of Blue roses, I highly recommend this method. Backwardsn\u2019s Efficient Method I came across an efficient method for making a blue rose from Backwardsn\u2019s Optimized ACNH Hybrid Recipes . He used an optimization procedure to figure this method out, and its quite different from the other methods. I believe this to be the fastest way to get a single blue rose, but if you want many blue roses I still recommend the above mass production method . I've summarized his method below: Plant Red (seed) and White (seed) flowers in a large blocked off pattern where the Red (seed) flowers are blocked off. 50% of the hybrids here will be a Red hybrids , which could be of two genetics (call them H1 and H2). Plant Red (H1/H2) from Step 2 and Yellow (seed) flowers in a large blocked off pattern where the Red (H1) flowers are blocked off. about 12% of the hybrids produced will be Red (H3) hybrids . You will also get some Yellow, Orange, and White hybrids here, discard them. Take all of the Red (H3) hybrids from Step 2 and plant into a dense or diagonal plot. 75% of hybrids produced will be Red , Orange , and Black roses. About 1.5% of the hybrids here will be Blue roses! You will also get Purple, White, and Yellow roses from this, discard them. Take all of the Red , Orange , and Black roses from Step 3 and plant them into a big dense block. The hybrids from this dense block will be all sorts of colors, but about 1/45 (2%) will be Blue roses Discard other hybrids from this block, but continue to add Red, Orange, and Black roses from Step 3 to increase the number of flowers and thus the chances of getting a Blue rose. The one downside to this method is that your odds of getting a Blue rose don't increase. Backwardsn has tried this with time-traveling and got a blue rose after 66 days.","title":"Roses"},{"location":"mass-production/roses/#roses","text":"Okay, let's be honest. You probably only care about two kinds of roses: gold and blue. They've been the coveted flower in Animal Crossing for a long time, and that's unlikely to change. Gold roses are special in New Horizons, as they aren't technically hybrids. They have a chance to appear off any Black rose that is watered with a Golden Watering Can (DIY recipe given once a 5 Star town is achieved). Blue roses are especially difficult to breed because roses are the only flower to use 4 different \"genes\" to make hybrids, which means there's actually 81 distinct roses (even though many of them look the same), as compared to 27 for other flower species. To make things more difficult, Blue roses have only 1 distinct combination that will work. There's a few different methods that have been proposed, and I thought I would try to mention them all here. The simple method The mass production method (based on Paleh's guide) The efficient method (discovered by Backwardsn) Which method should you use? If you want to build a blue rose flower factory and are willing to put in the time, the mass production method is your best bet. If you want an efficient and easy way to make a few blue roses, then the efficient method is right for you. For the classic, tried and true method, see the simple method .","title":"Roses"},{"location":"mass-production/roses/#simple-method-for-blue-roses","text":"The simple method for Blue roses can be broken down in the following table, which shows some of the basic breeding patterns for roses starting from the seed bag flowers: Hybrid Color Parent 1 Parent 2 Chance Other possible colors Orange Red (seed) Yellow (seed) 50% Yellow Black Red (seed) Red (seed) 25% Red (seed), Pink Pink Red (seed) Red (seed) 25% Red (seed), Black Pink Red (seed) White (seed) 50% Red Purple White (seed) White (seed) 25% White (seed), White Orange (2) Black Yellow (seed) 100% - Red (special) Orange Purple 25% Red (not special), White Blue Red (special) Red (special) 1.5% Anything There's a few rows of this table that aren't needed, but may be useful in breeding other colors. Here's a step-by-step guide for breeding Blue roses by this simple method. Plant a plot of White (seed) roses. These White roses will mostly produce other white roses, but 25% of the hybrids will be Purple roses. Throw out the new White roses that appear, as they may have different genes than the ones you planted from seed bags. Move the purple roses into a separate area for the moment. Plant a plot of Red (seed) and Yellow (seed) roses in a large diagonal pattern so that only Reds are touching Yellows. 50% of the hybrids here will be Orange ; move them to a separate area. The other 50% will be Yellow , but different than the Yellow seed flowers. Plant these flowers elsewhere to prevent contamination. Take the Purple hybrids from Step 1 and the Orange hybrids from Step 2 and plant them in a large diagonal pattern so that only Purple roses are touching Orange roses. 25% of the hybrids that appear from this plot will be Red (special) hybrids that are different from the Red roses in seed bags. These are the Red roses that are capable of making Blue hybrids. Another 25% of the hybrids will be Red (not special) hybrids. These are also different from the Red roses in seed bags, but they have no ability to make Blue hybrids. It's impossible to tell the difference from this method. The other 50% of hybrids will be White. Throw these away or plant elsewhere. Take all of the Red hybrids (special and not special) into one large plot. Having a dense block patterns helps here to allow for the most combinations of flowers. Continue to grow this plot with flowers from Step 3 as you will want as many flowers as possible. About 1.56% of the hybrids from two Red (special) parents will make the coveted Blue rose. Unfortunately, your chances of getting one are small because you will have many red roses in this plot that will never make Blue. If you can build this plot to be quite large, the odds will increase and you will eventually have yourself a blue rose.

Plant White (seed) windflowers in diagonal shape pattern When White hybrids appear, throw them away (or sell, or plant elsewhere), because some of them are White windflowers that will never produce Blue. 25% of the hybrids in this areas will be Blue hybrids.

Continue replacing White (seed) flowers with Blue hybrids, starting with the White (seed) flowers that touch the most Blue flowers, then those touching the most other White (seed) flowers. A Blue hybrid bred with a Blue hybrid will only spawn a Blue (4x as likely as the White + White combination). Eventually, after repeating step 3 many times, the entire flower bed will be Blue flowers. At this point, every hybrid in this area will also be Blue , and you will be mass producing Blue flowers! To Mass Produce Purple Windflowers Purple are the rarest of the windflower variety. They are tricky, but follow this guide and you will soon have tons of them. I'll break this down into two large steps: Getting Purples Fast and Transitioning to Mass Production . Getting Purples Fast Most guides I see are showing the special pink method for getting purples, but there's a trick to using special reds that will bring you purples at least twice as fast (updated based on Backwardsn's reserach ). Here's the secret: Make Blue hybrid flowers from a White (seed) and a White (seed) hybridization. Breed Blue flowers with Red (seed) flowers in a blocked off pattern to create Red (special) flowers. The blocked off pattern is important to prevent Red (seed) clones from appearing. It's currently thought that any flower hasa chance to create a clone of itself instead of a hybrid. Provided there are no clones, 100% of the hybrids from the breeding will be Red (special) flowers. Plant all of the Red (special) flowers into another plot in a diagonal pattern. Each pair of flowers that are touching will have 6.25% of their hybrids become Purple . Take purples and go to the next section. The remaining non-purple hybrids can have any kind of genetics. Save all of the blue flowers from Step 3. Roughly 2/3 of them are Blue (special) hybrids which can be used to make more purples. See the next section for more details. Notes: It helps to reserve a fairly large space of land for step 3, as you will want to accumulate many Pink (special) and Red (special) flowers to increase the chances of getting purples. Transitioning to Mass Production Guide coming soon . I think the best option is to start planting the purples in the middle of the Pink (special) and Red (special) plot to increase the odds from 6.25% to 25% on the pairs containing a purple. As you get more purples, make as many of them touch as you can, since purple + purple = purple 100% of the time. I'm checking to see if there's any other way that's more efficient.
