# Windflowers

Windflowers might be my favorite overall flower.  They don't have the pedigree that Roses do, but I personally think they look great.  Windflowers come in Red, Orange, and White seeds, and you can make Pink, Blue, and Purple hybrids.  Pink and Blue are straightforward, but purple hybrids take some time to make.

## How to get each hybrid

| Hybrid Color   | Parent 1       | Parent 2       | Chance | Other possible colors                |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|-------:|--------------------------------------|
| Pink           | Red (seed)     | Orange (seed)  | 100%   | -                                    |
| Blue           | White (seed)   | White (seed)   | 25%    | White (seed), White                  |
| Red (Special)  | Blue           | Red (seed)     | 100%   | -                                    |
| Red (Special)  | Pink           | Blue           | 25%    | Pink (Special), Orange, White (seed) |
| Pink (Special) | Pink           | Blue           | 25%    | Red (Special), Orange, White (seed)  |
| Purple         | Red (Special)  | Red (Special)  | 6.25%  | All                                  |
| Purple         | Pink (Special) | Pink (Special) | 6.25%  | All                                  |

## To Mass Produce Blue Windflowers <img src="https://i.imgur.com/F5W0X0b.png" alt="drawing" height="40" align="top"/>

If all you want is a lot of blue windflowers, the method to mass produce them is very straightforward.  However, know that if you want to make purple windflowers, you will actually make plenty of blue along the way, and it might be better to follow the steps [to mass produce purple windflowers](windflowers.md#to-mass-produce-purple-windflowers).  

1. Plant **White (seed)** windflowers in diagonal shape pattern
    - When **White** hybrids appear, throw them away (or sell, or plant elsewhere), because some of them are White windflowers that will *never* produce Blue.  
    - 25% of the hybrids in this areas will be **Blue** hybrids. Once a blue hybrid appears, go to step 2. 
2. Replace **White (seed)** flowers with **Blue** hybrid
    - A **Blue** hybrid bred with a **White (seed)** is twice as likely (50%) to spawn a **Blue**.
    - Once you get another **Blue** hybrid, go to step 3.
3. Continue replacing **White (seed)** flowers with **Blue** hybrids, starting with the **White (seed)** flowers that touch the most **Blue** flowers, then those touching the most other **White (seed)** flowers.  
    - A **Blue** hybrid bred with a **Blue** hybrid will only spawn a **Blue** (4x as likely as the White + White combination).

Eventually, after repeating step 3 many times, the entire flower bed will be **Blue** flowers.  At this point, every hybrid in this area will also be **Blue**, and you will be mass producing **Blue** flowers!

## To Mass Produce Purple Windflowers <img src="https://i.imgur.com/lxv3v8f.png" alt="drawing" height="40" align="top"/>

Purple are the rarest of the windflower variety.  They are tricky, but follow this guide and you will soon have tons of them.  I'll break this down into two large steps: **Getting Purples Fast** and **Transitioning to Mass Production**.  

### Getting Purples Fast

Most guides I see are showing the special pink method for getting purples, but there's a trick to using special reds that will bring you purples *at least twice as fast* (updated based on [Backwardsn's reserach](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1anxm3WwEKyh0_-l_lZIAUETaa_q432Px3griacQ3NcU/edit#heading=h.d5gne7gi40vy)).  Here's the secret:

1. Make **Blue** hybrid flowers from a **White (seed)** and a **White (seed)** hybridization. 
2. Breed **Blue** flowers with **Red (seed)** flowers in a [blocked off pattern](/../breeding-patterns.md#blocked-off-patterns) to create **Red (special)** flowers.
    - The blocked off pattern is important to prevent **Red (seed)** clones from appearing.  It's currently thought that any flower hasa chance to create a clone of itself instead of a hybrid.  
    - Provided there are no clones, 100% of the hybrids from the breeding will be **Red (special)** flowers.
3. Plant all of the **Red (special)** flowers into another plot in a diagonal pattern.  Each pair of flowers that are touching will have 6.25% of their hybrids become **Purple**.  Take purples and go to the next section.  The remaining non-purple hybrids can have any kind of genetics.  
4. Save all of the blue flowers from Step 3. Roughly 2/3 of them are **Blue (special) **hybrids which can be used to make more purples.  See the next section for more details.  

<!-- 4. Start with a **Pink** flower from a Red (seed) and Orange (seed) hybridization, and a **Blue** flower from a **White (seed)** and a **White (seed)** hybridization. 
    - IT'S IMPORTANT TO USE SEED FLOWERS HERE.  Otherwise, you may not have the correct genes and you may be wasting your time.  
5. Breed your **Pink** and **Blue** flowers.  Depending on how many of each, you can use isolated X patterns, cross patterns, or connected cross patterns.  Just make sure each blue is only touching pink and each pink is only touching blue.  4 flowers can come from this hybridization: **Pink (special), Red (special), Orange, and White (seed)**.   -->

<!-- TODO: Add percentages of other hybrids in case people care about those -->

Notes: It helps to reserve a fairly large space of land for step 3, as you will want to accumulate many Pink (special) and Red (special) flowers to increase the chances of getting purples.  


### Transitioning to Mass Production

*Guide coming soon*.  I think the best option is to start planting the purples in the middle of the Pink (special) and Red (special) plot to increase the odds from 6.25% to 25% on the pairs containing a purple.  As you get more purples, make as many of them touch as you can, since purple + purple = purple 100% of the time.  I'm checking to see if there's any other way that's more efficient.  

## Details: Genetics of each flower

Windflowers use 3 genes: R, O, W.  

<center>

| Name           | Genetics |
|----------------|----------|
| White (seed)   | rr-oo-Ww |
| Red (seed)     | RR-oo-WW |
| Orange (seed)  | rr-OO-WW |
| Blue           | rr-oo-ww |
| Pink           | rr-oo-ww |
| Pink (special) | Rr-Oo-Ww |
| Red (special)  | Rr-oo-Ww |
| Blue (special) | Rr-oo-ww |
| Purple         | RR-**-ww |
