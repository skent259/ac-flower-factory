## How to get each hybrid

| Hybrid Color   | Parent 1       | Parent 2       | Chance | Other possible colors     |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|-------:|---------------------------|
| Pink           | Red (seed)     | Orange (seed)  | 100%   | -                         |
| Blue           | White (seed)   | White (seed)   | 25%    | White (seed), White       |
| Pink (Special) | Pink           | Blue           | 25%    | Red, Orange, White (seed) |
| Purple         | Pink (Special) | Pink (Special) | 6.25%  | All                       |


## Mass produce Blue

If all you want is a lot of blue windflowers, the method to mass produce them is very straightforward.  However, know that if you want to make purple windflowers, you will actually make plenty of blue along the way, and it might be better to follow the mass product purple procedure.  

1. Plant **White (seed)** windflowers in diagonal shape pattern
    - When **White** hybrids appears, throw them away (or sell, or plant elsewhere), because some of them are White windflowers that will *never* produce Blue.  
    - 25% of the hybrids in this areas will be **Blue** hybrids. Once a blue hybrid appears, go to step 2. 
2. Replace **White (seed)** flowers with **Blue** hybrid
    - A **Blue** hybrid bred with a **White (seed)** is twice as likely (50%) to spawn a **Blue**.
    - Once you get another **Blue** hybrid, go to step 3.
3. Continue replacing **White (seed)** flowers with **Blue** hybrids, starting with the **White (seed)** flowers that touch the most **Blue** flowers, then those touching the most other **White (seed)** flowers.  
    - A **Blue** hybrid bred with a **Blue** hybrid will only spawn a **Blue** (4x as likely as the White + White combination).

Eventually, after repeating step 3 many times, the entire flower bed will be **Blue** flowers.  At this point, every hybrid in this area will also be **Blue**, and you will be mass producing **Blue** flowers!




## Details: Genetics of each flower

Windflowers use 3 genes: R, O, W.  

| Name          | Genetics |
|---------------|----------|
| White (seed)  | rr-oo-Ww |
| Red (seed)    | RR-oo-WW |
| Orange (seed) | rr-OO-WW |
| Blue          | rr-oo-ww |
|               |          |
