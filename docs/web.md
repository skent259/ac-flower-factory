## Javascript

### Definitions

**Node** - asynchronous event driven JavaScript server-side runtime (javascript outside of the browser)

**NPM vs Yarn** - both package managers for Node, npm is the one built in, yarn is the one that is facebook open source.

**Grunt vs Gulp vs Webpack** - both are tas runners, automating basic tasks in web dev. ie  processing sass files. Webpack bundles a bunch of stuff into a few final files. Then all the modules that depend on each other it'll help package it all up into static assets. Also has a little task runner included. Webpack has become WAY more popular.

### Packages

* [budo](https://github.com/mattdesl/budo) - could help with rapid development. Nadieh Bremer uses it for live refresh I think
* [rough.js](https://roughjs.com/) - make graphics with a sketch appearance, which looks really nice! and custom!
