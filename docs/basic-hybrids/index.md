# Basic Hybrids

This section is dedicated to an accurate listing of how to get each hybrid variety for each flower in Animal Crossing New Horizons.  It is based on the brilliant work of Paleh and Aeter (and many others), which can be found in the following [Google Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ARIQCUc5YVEd01D7jtJT9EEJF45m07NXhAm4fOpNvCs/edit).

For flowers to breed, they need to be touching (diagonal is okay) and watered.  It's unclear how many hybrids will spawn each new day.  

The following tables show how to get each hybrid color.  **Note**: this is *not* every possible way to get the hybrid color flower.  The tables show the *most common* ways to get the hybrids, usually starting from seed flowers.  In general, it is risky to use bred versions of standard flowers (for example, a white flower that comes from two white flower parents), since they may have differing genes.
